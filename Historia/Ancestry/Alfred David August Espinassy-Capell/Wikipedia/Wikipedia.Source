(London, 1924), p. 870.</ref> His parents met at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball|famous ball]] held in [[Brussels]] the night before the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref name=times/>

His paternal grand-father was [[Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy]] who was a member of the council that decided the fate of [[Louis XVI]] of France in [[Trial of Louis XVI|his trial]] after the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=times/> His maternal grand-father was John Thomas Capell, half-brother of [[George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex]].<ref name=burke/>

On 27 April 1881, at Kiltoom church in [[County Roscommon]], [[Ireland]], D'Espinassy de Fontanelle married Lucy Stuart, daughter of Capt.

==Military service==
D'Espinassy de Fontanelle entered the French Army and joined the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]], taking part in the [[Crimean War]]. In the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]] he was shielded by one of his men from a cannon ball; later in the fight he was severely wounded and his left arm was amputated as a result. His noted gallantry led to his promotion to the rank of [[Captain]], as well as his decoration of Knight Cross of the Order of the [[Legion of Honor]].<ref name=times/>

While recovering from the effects of the amputation he spent some time on board [[HMS Princess Royal]], commanded by his cousin, Lord [[Clarence Paget]]. On his return to France he was appointed [[Major]] of the 1st Grenadier Regiment of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. At the close of the war in Italy he received honorable mention, retired from the army and he was appointed sous-préfet of [[Rambouillet]], where he was stationed at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870.<ref name=times/>

He was captured while defending [[Rambouillet]] and sent to the fortress of [[Ehrenbreitstein]] in Germany, where he was imprisoned. After three months, he obtained parole and for the remainder of his captivity made friends among the military authorities of the fortress. He was released at the end of the war and returned to France, but his health had been badly affected by his imprisonment and he retired from public life.<ref name=times/>

==Marquisate of Fontanelle==
