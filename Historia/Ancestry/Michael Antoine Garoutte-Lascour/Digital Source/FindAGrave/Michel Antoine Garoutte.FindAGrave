Masculine American-English Pronunciation: My-Kull, Gee-Uh-Root ) the ghost of Historic Pleasant Mills, New Jersey.

His ghost can sometimes be seen in twilight and night time on the old Pleasant Mills trail in Historic Pleasant Mills, New Jersey by the Old Paper Mill which is where his Tavern: The La Fayette was once located.

Born on the 12th of April in the year 1750 in the Château or Castle Garoutte in Marseille, Kingdom of France. Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour was a French noble who fought in the American Revolutionary War of Independence.

He and his 16 years older sister the Lady Marie Magdeleine Garoutte-Lascour were the only surviving children of the Royal French Navy Admiral Antoine Garoutte whose known membership along with his daughter's husband the Baron of Signes, Kingdom of France, César Antoine Espinassy-Venel was the Dynastic Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis IX of the Kingdom of France and his wife the Lady Marie Anne Félicitié de Lascour.

Louis le Bien-Aimé who became the King of France as Louis XV in 1715 appointed Antoine Garoutte to the Admiralty of the Royal French Navy in 1753. Their names are written in the Books and Charters for this Order as well as in others. Not all materials of the Orders survived the 3 major French Revolutions nor the 5 French Republics into present day. The Pope of the Catholic Church was often involved in disputes between the Dukes of France where one would contest the succession of the other to the Kingship of the Kingdom of France.
Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour sailed to the New Jersey Colony commanding 2 ships in 1774 where later he played significant roles in the cause for American Independence. He married the Quakeress, Sophia "Sophie" Smith.

His sister's family were among the first supporters of Napoléon Buonaparte. They were also among the first French nobles to reform the French Government in the French Revolution and the Lady Marie Magdeleine Garoutte-Lascour's son Antoine Joseph Marie Espinassy-Garoutte ascended to the rank of General in the Army of the French Revolution and he was twice elected a Deputy of the Department of Var in France and a Representative in the Lower House Legislature of the first Republic of France.

Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour's niece the Lady Claire Charlotte Espinassy-Garoutte is academically famous for her written works namely History of Europe, History of France, How To Be a Lady and Nouvel Abrégé de l'Histoire de France
à L'usage des Jeunes Gens -- where the present-day nobility of numerous countries in the world as well as Universities still use these works to teach about the Nobility, European History and other topics.

Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour and Marie Magdeliene Garoutte-Lascour's families' played important roles in the formation of the first French Republic. Their family was partially responsible for the 1793 voted regicide of the 12th Duke of Berry, Louis-Auguste who became the King of France as Louis XVI in 1774.

While the Espinassy-Garoutte family were expelled from France hiding in Switzerland before the restoration of the Bourbons to France under Louis Stanislas Xavier who became the King of France as Louis XVIII in 1813 the Espinassy-Garoutte family ultimately fled to England and married into the English Royal House of Capell through the 6th Earl of Essex, Arthur Algernon Capell's family at a Masquerade Ball the night before the Battle of Waterloo. The family returned to France to facilitate the succeeding French Republics.

Their names are listed in the Peerage of England and France. All legitimate-biological direct and direct-lineal descendants of Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour and his sister Marie Magdeleine Garoutte-Lascour have provable and traceable French-Bourbon, French-Capetian, Robertian and other royal ancestry through numerous Royal French bloodlines. Michel Antoine Garoutte is a grand-son of the Baron Henri Lascour.

The children, cousins, nephews and nieces of Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour and his sister inherited over 24 castles in France during and after the French Revolution. Their grand-daughter married the Count of Narcillac du Chastil de Andelot, Claude Joseph Ernest who like the Garoutte-Lascour family is also an irrefutable direct descendant of the King of France, Louis IX.

Napoléon Buonaparte's older brother the Corsican King of Spain and Indies for a short time Joseph Buonaparte built a large mansion just less than 15 miles from Michel Antoine Garoutte's estate in South New Jersey in ~1815. The Buonaparte Mansion served as the central hub for French Expatriates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This mansion was later burned to the ground by angered European-American settlers after its resident.

The 6th Marquis of la Fayette, Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier was Michel Garoutte's childhood friend and school-fellow in the Kingdom of France and he was twice his guest in 1824 in New Jersey, United States.

All of Garoutte's named children married into notable American families. John Sevier, Junior the son of John Sevier who was the founder and first Governor of the U.S. State of Tennessee, James Jennings who was given half of the present day Cherokee National Forest, Archebel MacAfee a wealthy Blacksmith.

The burial location for Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour is lost. There are a few of his descendants searching for the location. The Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots says Michael Garoutte is buried in Plot Number: 25 in the Methodist Episcopal Cemetery in Batsto-Pleasant Mills, New Jersey, United States. In December 2016 we found his grand-son buried in this cemetery but not Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascour yet, we are still searching.
