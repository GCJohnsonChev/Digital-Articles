Michel Antoine Garoutte belonged to an old [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provençal Provençal] family of the nobility. His father Antoine Garoutte was an ( Admiral ) of the Royal French Navy, a wealthy le ( Capitaine ) of French ships, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Louis Knight ( Chevalier ) of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis IX of The Kingdom of France] and later The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general ( Attorney General )] of the Southern Division of the Kingdom of France for a short time ( Called, Written: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence Provence] and Pronounced: Pro-Vawn-S ) and owner of a small fleet of merchant ships.

Some of the Admiral ( Sir ) Antoine Garoutte's and the Espinassy's merchant shipping deals were a joint partnership of M.M. Rigaud, Vernet & Company Shipping out of Marseille, Kingdom of France. This profitable merchant shipping business dealt in sugars and tobaccos and possibly cotton from Saint Dominique Colony. They also used their merchant and privateer vessels to ship arms and materials to French Colonies in Saint Dominique and Canada. The Espinassy-Venel Family also had a merchant branch to fund their estates in the Kingdom of France. Both Garoutte and d'Espinassy Families were exempted from tax by the Kings of France and Anjou.

Antoine's father Henri Garoutte was also The ( Attorney General ) of the Southern Division of the Kingdom of France before him. Michel Antoine Garoutte's mother was The ( Lady ) Anne de La Scours ( d'Lascours ) whose real name was The ( Lady ) Marie Anne Félicité d'Lascours of the French nobility whose grand-father was the uncle of the King of France.

The Garoutte Family were also connected to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry Landed Gentry] of the Kingdom of France which was called the Nobility of the Land and the Garoutte's were also Nobility of the Sword and of the Cloth.

Michel Antoine Garoutte's paternal grand-father's name was Henri Garoutte and his wife's name was The ( Lady ) Angelique de Pistre. Henri Garoutte's father was Honore Garoutte and his wife's name was The ( Lady ) Anne Marguerite Guinoard-Mascaron. All Garoutte's in this line are Direct-Lineal descendants of French Feudal Lords and Ladies with lines to the Ancient French Nobility and thus are more than likely descendants of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne Charlemagne The ( Emperor ) of the Holy Roman Empire and The ( King ) of the Franks]. The d’Lascours line can be traced back to about 1345 to a ( Knight ) and Fisherman of the name of [http://gw.geneanet.org/cousinjeanne?lang=en&pz=joan+marie&nz=gross&ocz=0&p=jacques&n=delascours&oc=7 Jacques d’Lascours] of what order is not known yet, but "Chevalier" is mentioned.

The d'Lascours were quite possibly in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades Crusades] all of them starting with The ( Lady ) Marie Anne Félicité d’Lascours and before her were French nobility or upper class which means this family was probably close to 8 - 16 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarters_of_nobility Quarterings] of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility Nobility].

''D'azur, a une colombe d'argent, becquee et membree de gueulese, portant en son bec un rameau d'or; au chef cousu de gueules charge de trois etoiles d'or.''

The Three Golden Stars supposedly symbolize military authority and the Silver Dove with the Golden Bough in its Beak is probably an allusion to the events in [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough_(mythology) Virgil's Poem The Golden Bough] where Aeneas was assisted by two doves in finding a Golden Bough which was required in order for him to board a ship to the underworld and see his dead father in Elysium.

Note: ''It seems that the naming of the members of these Noble Houses would depend upon the joining surnames of their parents. If the mother was de Venel and the father was d’Espinassy the child would be d’Espinassy de Venel or Espinassy-Venel and if the child would marry a member from a different Noble House that was not de Venel their children would be named d’Espinassy without de Venel, although they still had de Venel blood. This seems to be the case with César-Antoine Joseph d’Espinassy de Venel and Marie Magdeleine Garoutte-Lascours’s Marriage where their children were named Garoutte d’Espinassy or Garoutte-Espinassy.''

''The reason for this is due to these noble houses belonging to long standing Feudal Fiefs with titles of nobility such is the case with Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy and his Marriage to The ( Lady ) Marie Guillaume de Tholomé de Fontanelle. She was the only daughter and child of her father The ( Marquis ) de Fontanelle and thus the title of ( Marquis ) and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquisate Marquisate] was inherited by their eldest son. This is why their children are named d'Espinassy de Fontanelle or Espinassy-Fontalle and the title of ( Marquis ) of Fontanelle was passed to their eldest son.''

''The Feudal Baronial Fief and Château ( Castle ) attached to Antoine Garoutte was inherited by Michel Antoine Garoutte by the laws of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture French primogeniture] although he seems to have allowed his sister to manage it after he left for the American Colonies.''

Born the youngest son he began education for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_(Catholic_Church) Catholic Priesthood] at a very young age which is something a youngest son would do in the nobility if he had an older brother that would inherit, but upon his older brother's death Michel inherited the estates and offices of his father a ( Baron ) of Provence, Kingdom of France due the rules of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture Primogeniture] his older brother had no heirs of his own so Michel exited the Priesthood Seminary and began running his father's estates and businesses.

Michel Garoutte was later in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chestnut_Neck Battle of Chestnut Neck] about October, 5, 1778 where the British burned one of Michel's private ships in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullica_River Mullica River] which was once called the [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/county/atlantic/Pinelands/ChestnutNeck.htm Little Egg Harbor River].

The British military forces arrived at Chestnut Neck, New Jersey with a strength of 400 men looking to neutralize the menacing Continental Privateers and burned down half the settlement along with many of the continental privateer vessels, murdered many men and women and looted the property. Garoutte was vastly outnumbered by the British and he and his men ran for cover into the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Barrens_(New_Jersey) New Jersey Pine Barrens].

When the British received word that The ( Count ) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_Pulaski Kazimierz Michał Władysław Wiktor Pułaski] was on his way to meet them with his military forces the British quickly left on their ships. The British suffered huge losses a week later when confronted by The ( Count ) Kazimierz Pułaski.

A historical passage mentions that Michel's ship that was sunk in the Mullica River could still be seen on a low tide near Sand Point all the way up to the 1920s, but now presently the ship is completely mush.

Another wreck, which is named the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_Wreck_Site Bead Wreck Site] which had countless precious Native American beads on it is possibly connected to Garoutte's activities due to this wreck being mentioned in Garoutte's historical documentation.

Letters from the American Government to Michel Antoine Garoutte state a repayment to Michel from the American Government for his loan of 60,000 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling#Currency_of_Great_Britain_(1707)_and_the_United_Kingdom_(1801) Pounds Sterling] equivalent ( a bond requirement of servicemen on private vessels ) where the repayment was a chest full of [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-issues-continental-currency Continental Dollars], <ref>Primary Source: Letters from the American Government [https://www.fold3.com/page/641446884_Michel_antoine%20garoutte/ Letters Online Click Here]</ref> which was worthless at the time and Michel's Children were allowed to play with it. <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): The French and American History of Michel Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXX</ref> Supposedly he received a chest full of silver cobs for his services later on.

{{Image|file=Garoutte-128-33.jpg

Note: ''It was standard for the newly established American Government to repay their investors with Continental Dollars and then after the war with goods, services and a pension. The Continental Dollars were highly inflated and they were only worth a fraction of the value of the precious metals in the other currencies in circulation of that time period. This is where the phrase [http://www.breedshill.org/continental_dollar.htm “It wasn't worth a Continental”] comes from.''

''Essentially before the Continental Establishment became an officially organized and united effort proponents of the efforts would encourage people to invest in the war. War investors invested in the war with actual money that had silver and gold in it and the continental establishment would repay the men in service to them with that invested money. After the American Revolution War the newly established government repaid their investors with worthless stamp money crafted by the individual Colony Government and later the Congress called Continentals while keeping the real wealth to themselves. Many war investors were furious about this and the American Government continued doing this even after it was declared and enforced as the United States.''

''Without the assistance of the French the American effort for Independence would have been lost. The French Monarchy paid for almost everything and gave them almost all of the guns, goods, uniforms and even thousands of French soldiers; there is also strong evidence that the French Monarchy and French nobles were shipping guns and giving material aid to the American Rebels as early as 1774 and before; they were abandoned in their time of need when the French Revolution sparked and Napoléon Bonaparte came into power and was supported by many noble French families. The U.S. at that point was heavily indebted to the French Monarchy.''

''Most colonists hated noblemen and they hated Catholics even more due to most colonists coming from a long history of Protestantism. They were uneducated and associated corruption with nobility especially the English nobility. Their deeply rooted hate for Catholics goes back to the Protestant Reformation. Michel Antoine Garoutte was both Catholic and a member of the first nobility in the Kingdom of France. Privateers were also often cheated by the Continental Establishment, but the privateers acquired vast wealth by hijacking British Navy Ships and British Merchant Vessels usually taking the goods for themselves. It was more lucrative for men to be in service to the Continental Establishment through Privateering.''

''Michel applied for a pension during the Pension Act of 1818 and after they would not allow his pension he requested another officer by the name of Ebenezer Tucker of Tuckerton, New Jersey to request his pension for him.''

''Michel was 72 years old when the government began pensioning its servicemen with certain disabilities under this law.''

''Ebenezer Tucker was an Officer that fought for The ( General ) George Washington in several military campaigns during the Revolutionary War and he was later in 1825 a Congressman and a Representative in the U.S. House of
Representatives from Burlington County, New Jersey.''

''Tucker wrote to the Pension Office on behalf of Michel Antoine Garoutte in 1822 <ref>Primary Source: Letter from Ebenezer Tucker on behalf of Michel Antoine Garoutte to the Pensions Department in Washington, D.C. [https://www.fold3.com/page/641446884_Michel_antoine%20garoutte/ Letters Online Click Here]</ref> and he represented him, but the pension request was still rejected because his service records were lost when the Records Department in the Court House burned during the Revolutionary War years earlier. Thus he was not able to prove his service.''

''The letters prove without a reasonable doubt that the established U.S. Government lied about the U.S. Navy ships
RaceHorse and Enterprise. The letters also prove the U.S. Government lied about some of Garoutte's American
Revolutionary War service.''

''Town records in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey do reveal that Michel was indeed referred to as ( Lieutenant ) Garoutte and these records mention that on public occasions he would dress up in his Continental Navy Uniform. Tucker was able to get the Continental Government to acknowledge Michel's services later on however, but he never received the pension. Had Garoutte been pensioned he would have received $5 per month from the U.S. Government.''

''Statements sent back by the Commissioner of Pensions Department in Washington, D.C. reveals that the Continental
Establishment and the then later U.S. Government claimed the Enterprise and RaceHorse never belonged to the
Continental Establishment <ref>Primary Source: Letters Sent Back To Michel Antoine Garoutte from Washington, D.C.

Michel and Sophie inherited Sophie's father's Inn in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasant_Mills Pleasant Mills, New Jersey]  and they renamed it to: The La Fayette. This tavern and inn was on the road from Pleasant Mills to Indian Cabin and interestingly the location of this tavern is listed on an earlier map as an Inn belonging to a J. Smith. They also ran a stage line that ran from English's Hotel to Joseph English's Ferry, Camden to Leads Point, opposite Bearmore's Beach which is the most convenient place at all times to pass to Long Beach, Tucker's Beach or Brigantine making multiple stops and ending at the La Fayette Tavern and Inn in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey for overnight lodging.

The service ran at 7:00 A.M. every morning and the fare was $2. <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): Iron in the Pines: The Story of New Jersey's Ghost Towns and Bog Iron, Page Number: 204 [https://books.google.com/books?id=aV-zFhKjT0MC&pg=204 Book Online Click Here]</ref> <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): The Wharton Ledgers, Volume: 14, Page Number: 344</ref> <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): Camden County Centennial, 1844 - 1944 [https://www.wikitree.com/photo.php/3/35/Garoutte-128-46.jpg Newspaper Image Online Click Here]</ref>

Garoutte's clients would enter into his very fine stage coaches which were luxurious carriages and be driven on a very scenic route all the way back to his tavern in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey, and depending on where the client was picked up the travel distance would be anywhere from 10 - 18 miles.

The coaches would stop at the La Fayette Tavern where the client would exit and make his way to the tavern for overnight drinking, luxurious feasts and lodging and the client would be driven back to town by before noon the next day.

====Letters From The ( Lady ) Marie Magdeleine Garoutte-Espinassy and Gifts From Royalty====

The ( Lady ) Marie Magdeleine Garoutte sent Michel's wife Sophie some gifts from The ( Queen ) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette Marie Antoinette of France] with a separate letter addressed to Sophie in February of 1787, just 2 years before the start of The French Revolution.

The gifts were to be handed down to Michel's eldest daughter of the eldest daughter ( Noblesse Uterine ) to present day. The gifts were some French silks and velvets and a scissors pin with the inscription of “Her Royal Highness” which is still in the family today. <ref>Primary Source: Handwritten Letters from Michel's Sister The ( Lady ) Marie Magdeleine Garoutte in Signes, Kingdom of France and Switzerland</ref> <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): The French and American History of Michel Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXXI</ref> <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): B-6 Chronicle Telegram, Byrie O., Sunday, July 4, 1971</ref>

One letter from Marie Magdeleine Garoutte addressed to Michel's wife Sophie dated February the 26th year 1787 from the Kingdom of France at Signes, and reads:

''Dear Sister-in-law:''

''I have seen with the greatest satisfaction my brother, your husband, after an absence of twelve years, without ever having heard from him. I assure you his arrival has given us the greatest pleasure, particularly so, as he informs me he has established himself and is so happy as to possess a respectable wife. I cannot think after all my brother has said, although he sets no bounds to the praises he gives you, yet I cannot help thinking he is inwardly chagrined, particularly when he speaks of his children. Can it be that my brother is not happy? Alas! He deserves to be for the natural goodness of his heart. Since he conceals his troubles from me, I address myself to you, madam, for to beg you to form me and shall be most happy if it is the means of removing them.''

''I will not conceal from you that your husband belongs to the first [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nobility Nobility of Provence in France] and, therefore, I beg you to be well persuaded of the sincere friendship with which I am for life, madam, dear Sister-in-law,''

Another letter was sent from Claire Charlotte d'Espinassy ( de Venel ) from the Kingdom of France at Signes dated February the 26th, year 1787 and reads:

''My dear Aunt:''

''I am going to assure you myself of the sincere friendship I have for you, after the praises given you by my uncle, your husband. We are enchanted with the connection which he has made. It is for this I beg you to be persuaded of the profound respect with which I am,''

Every child of Michel married into notable families. For instance Sophia Garoutte, Michel's daughter, married The ( Major ) John Sevier Junior who was the son of The ( General ) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sevier John Sevier] Senior who was the first ( Governor ) of the State of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee Tennessee] and its Founding Father ( 3rd Marriage, 10 Children ), <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): Sevier Family History Book, Page Number: 240</ref> <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): Notable Southern Families, Volume: IV, The Sevier Family, Page Numbers: 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197.

The Jennings, MacAfees and Seviers were all related by marriage by each of their marriages to daughters and grand-daughters of Michel Garoutte. They all lived near each other and Jennings was granted 40,000 acres of land by The ( Governor ) John Sevier. The land bordered the present day Cherokee National Forest.

The MacAfees and Jennings later donated many acres of land to the Mount Tabor Methodist Church in Greene County, Tennessee, United States of America. The Church still stands and operates today. Archebel MacAfee and his wife Bethia Garoutte are buried there.

Michel had traveled to the Sevier and MacAfee Estates just before he traveled to the Earling Estate and the Seviers and MacAfees had apparently stole money from him.

Garoutte had written in his Bible Notes:

''I left the house of the blacksmith and the Seviers, after they had served me with the greatest villainy in the world, and I am determined after my death to make them know their evil conduct, and on October 23rd I arrived at the home of my daughter Mary Earling, after 4 days of walking, because I had left without having a penny in my pocket.'' <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): The French and American History of Michel Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXXIII</ref>

A week later Garoutte mentions:

''I intend to gather my gold and return to France.'' <ref>Primary Source: Recovered Fragment of The Michel Garoutte Journal. Translated into English</ref>

Garoutte had written in his Journal that he felt like John Sevier stole his daughter Sophia Garoutte away from him and that he had lost hope of ever seeing her again.

Michel referred to Archebel MacAfee as ''The Blacksmith'' in the Garoutte Bible Notes and he mentions that he did not like the Seviers or the MacAfees after what they did to him. <ref>Secondary Source ( Publication ): The French and American History of Michel Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXXIII</ref>

====Burial====

Nearly all of the headstones in the [http://www.batstovillage.org/church-1.htm Batsto-Pleasant Mills Cemetery] are worn down. We are working on locating the exact location and headstone by going though the burial records. According to the Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots he is buried in the Methodist Episcopal Cemetery in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey, United States of America.

====England====

===Rights of Nobility of Americans===
''Michel Antoine Garoutte's older sister's marriage to César-Antoine Joseph Espinassy-Venel gives a right to the direct inheritance of the Earldom of Essex in England as well as the other inherited titles of nobility in France to the eldest surviving first born child of Michel Antoine Garoutte due to English and French laws of nobility and primogeniture. English law states that an inherited Peerage would automatically pass to the earliest marriage and only to the oldest male bloodline. The law states they would rather take the uncle's bloodline over a younger son and that a Peerage would automatically pass to the earliest provable male heir of the earliest marriage.''

''Any direct and direct-lineal senior male descendant heir of Michel Antoine Garoutte-Lascours and his wife Sophia Garoutte who wants to claim the Earldom of Essex in England can apply for the British Peerage of England through the present day Lord Chancellor of England or Queen Elizabeth II of England. Any descendant heir can publicly disclaim the Peerage by a series of steps. If anyone applies they will need to prove the finest parent to parent details from the claimant to Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy and his son's wives Lady Capell.'' There may also be another senior mode of descent from this Earldom through Michel Antoine Garoutte.

''All male Garoutte descendants will always have a legitimate claim to the Earldom of Essex in England due to English Laws governing nobility. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_peer Please see this Wikipedia Article: The Hereditary Peerage of England]''

===U.S. Amendment Nobility Clause===
''As of 1810 the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titles_of_Nobility_Amendment amendment] of the constitution of the United States concerning nobility is not ratified therefore stripping U.S. citizenship from a claimant would not happen if a U.S. citizen national descendant of Garoutte made a claim. Multiple citizenship would be conferred: French and British.''

==Louis Capet of France==

Michel Antoine Garoutte directly descends ( [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_descendant Direct-Lineally] ) from the uncle of Louis Capet the King of France through le ( Baron ) Henri d'Lascours.

==Differences In Heirdom==

===Claimant===
In English and French laws of nobility the term Claimant means a claimant applicant to a title of nobility based on hereditary rights.

===Heir-Presumptive===
In English and French laws of nobility the term Heir-Presumptive means that it is presumed but can be disputed that the noble title should go to x person or descendant in a bloodline because there are no other claims.

===Heir-Apparent===
In English laws and French of nobility the term Heir-Apparent means that it is apparent but can be disputed that the noble title should go to x person or descendant in a bloodline because there are no other claims.

===Indisputable===
In English and French laws of nobility the term Indisputable means that it is completely indisputable and without contestation that the noble title should go to x person or descendant in a bloodline because all claims and bloodlines have been investigated and no other senior descendant exists.

===Proving Descent===

====Legal Documented Proof====
If Michel Antoine Garoutte is your direct ancestor you can easily prove descent in the legal context by obtaining certified copies of each birth certificate, census record and bible record from parent to parent back to Michel Antoine Garoutte.

==Disproving Pension Office==
The statements made by Pension Department Official Earl D. Church in response to a pension claim by Garoutte was that "The Enterprise and RaceHorse never belonged to the Continental Establishment". That statement is easily disproved by the overwhelming volume of documentation proving otherwise today.

==Black Nobility==
Watch out for the Black Nobility. Stay away from anyone belonging to the Black Nobility except for the nobility of present day South France. The Black Nobility is not a friend even of many Catholics and especially the Anglican Church. I would also stay away from the Anglicans as well.
