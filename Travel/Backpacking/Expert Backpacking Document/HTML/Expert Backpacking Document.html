<B>This Guide</B><HR>
With this guide you can enforce information security and diversion so as to prevent any enemies from gathering any information on you and your location. You will also setup diversion social media accounts and pass around the information to enemies so as to trick anyone you feel is a threat. All of the electronics and the materials require physical and digital information security hardening. Custom security hardened firmwares and more. LinuxBIOS / CoreBoot / LineageOS and more. It looks like basic stuff but once hardened this stuff will take care of you. It will make it just about impossible for anyone to get information on you, pick pocket you or switch your stuff out / drug you. This combined with other offensive techniques that cannot ever be proved should secure your well being. It depends on your exact situation but obviously you would want certain people to know where you’re at 24/7 while making it impossible for enemies to know where you’re at. You can carry all of this stuff around with you in a neat and tidy backpack for an ultra clean and organized appearance. The actual software makes it very easy to get by with absolutely no money at all. The second part of this guide shows how to pick up on any language and how to memorize 10,000 words in that language in 365 days. I don’t travel anymore and I will never travel again. But I am now starting to write this expert backpacking guide to help out other people.<BR><BR>

<B>Proving Who You Are, Proving Your Exact Location and Why You Need To</B><HR>

<B>* Proving Your Location</B><BR>
You will always need to be able to prove who you are and where you are at long distance to your people 24/7 down to 3 feet by using G.P.S. coordinates within a 3 foot radius and within a 3 foot altitude of the 3 foot radius. I have written certain digital programming code and digital web applications that enables you to do this without the use of mainstream social media services. This should make it extremely difficult for anyone to modify the G.P.S. coordinates reported unless they get physical access to the server running the web applications. The 5th generation NR type and other types of 5g cellular networks are difficult for criminal organization to spoof by using IMSI catchers because of the frequency pitch. It is also difficult for them to G.P.S. jam the 5g cell phones that use the higher 5g frequencies. G.P.S. location jamming is easily defeated by staying out in the open as well as by using the G.P.S. reporting log for an exact foot by foot traceback of the device. The web application keeps a perfect log of G.P.S. movement at 1 - 5 second interval updates so if G.P.S. jamming or spoofing ever occurred at any point in time in any location then the log from the private server could be read and all of the steps and movement could be traced to the point of jamming. Mainstream social media makes it possible for those who are in control of it to change / modify the uploaded images and information. If this becomes a problem then you cannot rely only on these services to store the images / videos / information. You will instead need to use a paid-for private server or setup a web server at home in addition to using public social media services for use as long distance communication and updates when you leave. If you cannot prove who you are to your friends / family / people down to 3 - 10 feet in radius and 3 feet in altitude at long distance from their locations then you place yourself in extreme risks. Every tourist location is watched by the local criminal groups. They usually gather information on targets for different criminal purposes.<BR><BR>

<B>* Establishing Legal Traceback and Why You Need To</B><BR>
By holding your identity documents up to the cameras at the stores and by showing the identity documents to the people who work in the stores along with buying something
from the store with a debit or credit card in your name you can establish a traceback of your identity information to that specific location at that exact point in time
unless the video camera recordings are deleted at a later time either deliberately or because of the stores' inability to store the video longer than a certain amount of time.
Usually the in store video camera recordings are deleted after 2 weeks unless there is a seen incident because the store is not capable of storing the video recordings.
Purcashing something at the store with a credit or debit card alone does not prove that it is you making the purchase therefore it does not prove your location.
Never go anywhere without an acceptible form of ID because simply being there and showing your face to people is not enough for anyone to identify you and trace
your origins back to your friends and family if in the event something happens to you. If you do not have any traceback to your location and no one knows your exact location
and identity information it is very easy for anyone or any group of people to kill you and then disappear you. If you are big it won't matter. It does not matter how long you have physically
trained for hand to hand offense and defense. You have up to 5 minutes to prove your location or you risk death up to 85% of the time. Most people don't remember names and faces, they remember the information on the IDs.
LEOs and investigators only go off of the documentation at hand so if there is trailing documentation that leads everyone right to your current location you do not need to worry about being disappeared. High traffic tourist areas sometimes
attract up to 25 million people a year. Places like these make it almost impossible for Law Enforcement to prove any crimes in the area if they happen. Always document your travels by taking pictures of all of the physical and digital tickets and store them
on your mobile devices. Only show the tickets on social media after the travel from point to point is complete just in case the schedules or routes have changed at any point in the travel.<BR><BR>

<B>* Making Your Presence Known</B><BR><BR>

<B>* Securing The Electronics</B><BR>
Never use a fingerprint, iris scan or face scan on any of the electronics to unlock them. Always use a pin code and change it frequently without anyone seeing the change. All cell phones and laptops can be unlocked by enemies if they take your hand, face or eye and hold it to the cell phone device to unlock it if in the event you are ever knocked out or killed. It is also possible to use clear tape to copy a fingerprint and then use it on the cell phone fingerprint sensor to unlock it. Once this happens and if a pin code is not set on the device the enemy or enemy group can then unlock the cell phone with your own finger, face or iris and then take physical control of your social media accounts and data to trick your family and your friends about your location after having diposed of your body.<BR><BR>

or enemy group can then unlock the cell phone with your own finger, face or iris and then take physical control of the connect accounts on the device such as social media accounts and their data in order
to trick your friends and family about your location after having disposed of your body. Be sure to set a pin code lock on the SIM card itself and flash your device
with official LineageOS or a customized Linux Operating System for mobile use. If the SIM card itself is set with a pin code this will make it more difficult to remove that SIM card and clone it.
SIM cloning involves removing the SIM card and then duplicating it so that a laptop with a SIM card slot can intercept the messages and phone calls in real time. If in the event you suspect or the scanners show your
SIM card has been cloned you must change the SIM card by buying a new SIM card from the store and then activate it in the cell phone service provider website portal. Once the cell phone device has been setup correctly
it cannot be physically cloned or remotely hacked unless the perpetrater manages to get physical access to the device to install a RAT or Remote Access Trojan. Many files on the Internet are injecteed with undetectable RATs thaqt cannot be detected by Malware scanners even by Linux and FreeBSD OS scanners. Refer to the security hardening guide for
the electronics to secure the electronics.

<B>* Instant Information Gathering On Targets</B><BR>
The combined system created by my team can instantly gather real time information on targets and spread the live videos by Smart Glasses around to all ~1,200 members on the server<BR><BR>

<B>* Proving Traceback</B><BR><BR>

<B>* Dealing With PickPockets, Room Thieves and Switcheroos</B><BR>
<B>PickPockets</B> are small gangs that usually work for the larger gangs in the area. The shown travel gear is nice and tight. By wearing tight clothing it makes it very difficult for PickPockets
to steal anything from you. Usually PickPockets will use a razor blade to cut the backpack or the pockets to steal a wallet or anything valuable. By staying away from crowded areas while traveling
with this gear you will reduce your chances of being PickPocketed up to 99% of the time<BR><BR>

<B>Room Thieves</B> are usually the people that work in the hotels, motels and other places. Room Thieves including AirBnB operators work in these places and
coordinate with the other gangs in the area to steal valuables from customers. By only taking your backpack and by living out of it rigorously while traveling and
then by taking it with you when you leave the room you can reduce your chances of your possessions being stolen up to 100% of the time. If your backpack is securely worn it cannot be taken off of your back.<BR><BR>

<B>Switcheroos</B>
Switcheroos are Room Thieves and others that will switch your authentic belongings out with fake products or damaged
products that are the exact same make and model. An example of a Switcheroo is someone that is in a gang and owns
a damaged or fake pair of RayBan glasses that are the exact same make and model of the new and non-damaged RayBan glasses
that you own and have with you. They would usually switch it out on you so they can get the real thing or get the newer
one for free. Think of a gang that owns a Ranchero car of a certain m ake and model and they decide to go and scope out the same
make and model vehicle so they can get a brand new carburetor out of it for free by popping the hood and then by taking
the carburetor part and switching it out with the damaged carburetor part in their Ranchero. You can always beat the Switcheroos by ownling
owning extremely customized gear. If the travel gear is original, custom amde and or extremely customized it cannot be duplicated
because it cannot be bought anywhere.. if it cannot be bought anywhere else then it cannot be switched out with yours.<BR><BR>

<B>Field Tested Gear</B><BR>
I have personally selected, assembled, customized and tested this gear for use on my travels. All of this gear is very long lasting and is physical and digitally hardened. Any backpacker with this specific gear can expect to stay clean, styled, physically and digitally secure as well as have the capability to walk 10 - 20 miles per day without stopping. No hurt feet, legs or back. You can also bug out long term with this specific gear. This gear is also good as a GoBag and as a Daily Bag.<BR><BR>

<B>Processing The Boots</B><BR>
Treating and hardening the Dr. Martens Nylon Hardened Edition boots with extra stitch reinforcements and fabric hardening with sole hardening material makes a stronger boot than any U.S. Military issue boot and just about every foreign military issued boot for use in dry and hot conditions today. You can walk for up to 18 miles per day over a 3 month period without the need to replace the outer sole goup or the inserts. No hurt feet as long as you use the right socks and memory foam inserts. The boots can be made to last for up to 1 year or longer with the right sole treatment.<BR><BR>
